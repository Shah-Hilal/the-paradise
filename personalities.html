<h3>*Habba Khatoon: </h3>
<p>When she was young, nobody knew that this girl from a small village of Chandrahar (Chandhaur) 
would become the most famous poetess of Kashmir one day. Habba Khatoon, also known as ‘The Nightingale of Kashmir’,
 was a famous Kashmiri poet of the 16th century. Since childhood she was very fond of singing. Most of her childhood 
 days were spent in saffron fields singing melodious Kashmiri folksongs. At a very young age, Habba’s parents got her
 married to an illiterate peasant boy, who never liked her singing. Hence her first marriage could not last longer.
 Habba’s destiny changed when Yousuf Shah Chak (Last Independent King of Kashmir), fascinated by her lovely voice and
 immense beauty, proposed her for marriage. It was indeed love at first sight. With their parents consent, Habba and 
 Yousuf got married. From that very day she was known as Habba Khatoon.</p>
