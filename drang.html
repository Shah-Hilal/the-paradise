Drang is another recently discovered tourist station in the beautiful Vale of Kashmir. It is located about 38 km north of Srinagar on Gulmarg road, just 3 km away from Tangmarg. The place is quite similar to Pahalgam with a fast water stream, known as Ferozpur-Nalla, flowing down. It is however a small place and is suitable for a day picnic or a short visit during your trip to Gulmarg.
</p>
<p>The road to Drang is in a good condition, except for the final three kilometres which are still under construction and will soon have a polished surface. The development work of this place has been undertaken by Gulmarg Development Authority, which is putting in fast efforts to bring it to the tourist map of Jammu and Kashmir. As of now the place is being promoted for trout fishing and rock climbing. The place does not have any restaurants or hotels, however, travellers can find accommodation in Tangmarg which is just 3 km away.</p>
<p>Drang was originally a tax collection point for the vehicles passing to Gulmarg. It became a favourite tourist destination due to the Ferozpur stream and the hills forming the backdrop. A park has been constructed along the banks of the Nalla.
</p>
<p><strong>Drang</strong> is a beautiful place, which is still fresh and protected from human interference. Pine forests and the stream with many log bridges make the place really beautiful. Many nearby places are also interesting. Across the hill is a place where you will find some monuments believed to be the ruins of the Pandava temples. Through the woodlands are some beautiful fields with pine trees lining them and old mud houses dotted here and there. A visit to the small village nearby is also interesting. </p>

<p>Zanskar road winds down the steep slopes of the watershed to the head of the Stod Vale, one of Zanskar's foremost tributary vales, the majestic "Drang-Drung" glacier looms into full view. A long and winding river of ice and snow, the Drang-Drung" is perhaps the biggest glacier in Ladakh, outside the Siachen formation. It is from the cliff-like snout of this widespread glacier that the Stod or Doda River, the main tributary of river Zanskar, rises.</p>
<p>
Transport is available up to Tangmarg and after that you can either walk or take a pony. Ideally you should visit the area on your visit to Gulmarg, which will add flavour to your trip. Gulmarg is the probably the only tourist place in Kashmir which does not have any water body in it, a visit to region will fulfil this aspect of the Gulmarg tour. Make sure to carry eatables and other necessary items along, if you wish to spend your day in Drang. </p>
