<div class="container">
<p>All the divisions of Jammu Kashmir witness different kind of seasons. The places differ in altitude and thus the climate, temperature and flavours also vary.</p>
<p>The state of J&K is bejeweled in nature’s glory, and celebrated by her gift of seasons – The Spring, The Summer, The Autumn and The Winter; creating a multi-fold charisma and swerving one’s imagination to the highest timber. These seasons lend an extravagantly beautiful atmosphere.</p>
<p>Enchanting, enticing the paradise’ open arms welcome tourists all year around! Promising something for everyone, Kashmir welcomes in each of its four seasons. Choose any season and you will never regret. Still, for preferences sake, the classification is as follows:</p>
<div class="bold">Spring: March to April end (0 to 5° Celsius in morning, 15-18° Celsius during day)</div>
<img src="images\seasons\spring.jpg" alt="SPRING" id="images" class="img-circle"/>
<p>Mustard blooming season, the whole of valley is overwhelmed with this sweet odour. Further, blossoms after blossoms of almond, cherry, apple, peach, pear and … thousands of flowers and fruits burst one after the other. One must witness nature’s welcome.</p>
<div class="bold">Summer: May to August (15-20° Celsius in morning – 20-30° Celsius in afternoon)</div>
<img src="images\seasons\summer.jpg" alt="Summer" id="images" class="img-circle"/>
<p>The temperature rises slightly filling the valley with pleasant weather. The valley appears painted with myriad colours with different hues spread all over. The maple tree “Chinar” leaves turn crimson for a very limited time, inviting the tourists to absorb the subtle changes.</p>
<div class="bold">Autumn: September to November, (18-25° Celsius day and 10-15° Celsius at night)</div>
<img src="images\seasons\autumn.jpg" alt="autumn" id="images" class="img-circle"/><p>The most awaited season when tourists flock in great numbers. The fallen Chinar leaves making the rustling sound, the mixture of warm & cold temperatures delight everyone. The best weather for sightseeing, for Shikara rides surprises all. This is the time when the green turns to gold, then to red and the same scenery changes itself it is difficult to believe.</p>
<div class="bold">Winter: December to February (5-10° Celsius day time, -4 to 2° Celsius nights)</div>
<img src="images\seasons\winter.jpg" alt="winter" id="images" class="img-circle"/><p>The winter seeps in and there is snow all over. Trees, roads, mansions, hill tops … all snow laden. A visual treat indicating skiing time at Gulmarg and enthusiasts make a beeline for that shot of adrenaline.</p>
<p>Every season brings different hues altogether. Choose your suitability from the table above and take the plunge.</p>
