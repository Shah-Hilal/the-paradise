The cable car was originally meant to take skiers up to the higher and tougher slopes, but it became a favourite among the picnickers as well because it is a beautiful way to access the higher and more beautiful places around It like Khilanmarg, Afarwat, Alpatthar lakes and many more. These places are even more beautiful than Gulmarg and remain snow-clad for the most part of the year.</p>
<p>However, the prime reason for the fame of area is not because of its being a tourist spot, but because of its slopes that are at par with the international standards of skiing. Gulmarg has been rated as one of the top five ski resorts of the world by CNN. The place witnesses a huge rush of skiers and tourists during winter. It is an important winter sport destination in entire Asia. When the meadow gets blanketed under splendid white powder from the heavens during winters, it adopts a beauty that can’t be found anywhere else in the world.
